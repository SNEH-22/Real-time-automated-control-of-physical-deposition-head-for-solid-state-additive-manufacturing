## 📌 Project: Novel Fixture for Additive Friction Stir Processing (AFSP)  

### 🔹 Objective  
To design an **efficient, reliable, and precise clamping & feeding fixture** for Additive Friction Stir Processing (AFSP), enabling controlled rod deposition and uniform material flow.  

### 🔹 Design Basis  
- A **research and design-backed project**.  
- **No fabrication yet** – can be achieved in future once the patent process progresses.  

### 🔹 Components & Roles  
1. **Rod Storage Carousel Tray** – Stores multiple aluminum rods in organized slots.  
2. **Robotic Arm System** – Picks rods and inserts them into spindle bore with precise alignment.  
3. **Rod Actuation Unit** – Applies uniform vertical downward force to feed rod.  
4. **Bearing-Coupled Pusher** – Allows free spinning while force is applied, prevents torque transfer.  
5. **Base Container** – Encloses all units and mounts on top of the machine.  
6. **Control System** – PLC/microcontroller with sensors for sequencing, feedback, and motion control.
